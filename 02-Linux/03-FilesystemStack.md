## 01. Filesystem Layered Diagram

| Filesystem Stack         |
| ------------------------ |
| Userspace                |
| Virtual Filesystem (VFS) |
| Drivers                  |
| SD CARD (HW)             |

### 1.1. Introduction:
**File system is part of Kernel-Space. all related files are located in separate directory.**

> [!From user-space perspective]
> FS is view of different Directories and Files in Storage Device (ex: SD Card).

> [!From kernel-space perspective] 
> It perform the mapping between the userspace view to actual storage in Hardware.

### 1.2. What is usage of Filesystem Stack?
It map between the User space file structure view and perform any needed operations over it through filesystem stack software.

### 1.3. Types of Filesystem:
There are different type of Filesystems for example, EXT3, EXT4, etc..

## 02. Virtual Filesystem
### 2.1. Definition:
##### Type of Filesystem "Abstract/Generic" that have the ability to add and remove different filesystem.
##### Commonly-Used in Linux.

## 03. Operations on VFS
**Everything in Linux is a file ... so to interact with hardware, you need to interact with a file**
#### 1. Add "Mount" a Specific type of Filesystem (ext3, ext4, hpfs, etc...).
Mount is simply link the Hardware Storage using a certain Entry Point, give it the ability to access storage drive through a Directory.
    - Specify the Hardware "Device File" and Filesystem type u need to mount with a Certain Directory
    ` $ mount <FS_TYPE> <PATH/DEVICE_FILE> <PATH/TARGET_DIRECTORY_IN_USERSPACE>`

#### 2. Remove "Unmount" a Specific type of Filesystem.
Unmount is simply break the link with Hardware Storage.
    - Specify only the  Hardware "Device File" or directory.
    ` $ unmount <PATH/DEVICE_FILE>`
    ` $ unmount <PATH/DIRECTORY_IN_USERSPACE>`

**There is a Hash table for all mounted devices in System.**

| Filesystem Type | Device Name | Directory |
| --------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| ext4            | sda         | /         |
| ext3            | sdb         | /home     |
| ...             | ...         | ...       |

## 04. root file-system
#### In System startup, for the Kernel to get up ... at least there should be one filesystem is mounted in VFS.
#### this filesystem is **rootfs** .. rootfs is mounted on **[ / ]**.
- Any other Filesystem is under this main filesystem.
.
#### 4.1. rootfs hierarchy contains:
**Root Filesystem contains either directories or files.**

- Change Permission: `$ chmod [u/g/a][+/-][r/w/x/a] <NAME>`.
- Get Directory Information: `$ ls -al`.
- **Get File Information:** `$ file/stat <FILE_NAME>`.


## 06. Main Operations in FS Stack. 
### 6.1. Storage Management on Device
Any Storage Device in *Hardware Layer* is available in user-space as Block Device File.. **[b]**.
- **Storage device files available under `/dev/<STORAGE_NAME>`**
- **Get Information about storage devices and its partitions.**
```
	$ lsblk	
```
#### 6.1.1. Create Partitions
##### Partition Description:
**[Type]** | **[Name]** | **[Number]** | **[Size]**
##### Partition Types:
1. **Primary** : Main Partition, can contain OS and boot from it "Bootable".
2. **Extended/Logical** : Just for Data Storage.
##### Summarized Steps:
Create Two Partitions, (1. Primary & 2. Logical).
1. Set Partition Type.
2. Set Partition Number.
3. Set First Sector.
4. Set Last Sector.
5. Save Changes.

##### Main Commands:
- List all System Partitions.
```
	$ fdisk -l
```
- Clear all Data in Partition or Storage Device.
```
	$ sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/<STORAGE/PARTITION_NAME>
```
- Unmount Device {in case it is mounted before manipulation}.
```
	$ sudo umount /dev/<STORAGE/PARTITION_NAME>
```
- Manipulate certain storage device 
	*Storage Device itself and Each Partition under it has standalone file to Manipulate it.*
```
	$ sudo fdisk /dev/<STORAGE/PARTITION_NAME>
	$ m -> "For help Manual"
```
- Create Partition.
```
	$ sudo fdisk /dev/<STORAGE_NAME>
	$ n      [New Partition]
	$ p      [Type: Primary]
	$ 1      [Number: 1]
	$ enter  [First Sector: default selection "Sector Size: 512Byte"]
	$ +200M  [Last Sector = Partition Size: 200M]
	$ w
```

####  6.1.2. Set File-System Types:
After Creation of a Partition, we need to set the File-System Type.
We need to check support FS types to the Kernel
```
	$ man fs
```
##### FS Types:
1. **ext2** : 
	1. It supports a maximum file size of 4TB.
	2. The maximum file name length is 255 bytes characters.
	3. It can track the state of the file system.
	4. No file journaling
2. **ext3** : 
	- Â It is better than ext2, because it has a journaling feature that is mainly required from a file system.
3. **ext4** :
	- It is better than ext3, it provides better performance, reliability, and scalability.

##### Main Commands:
- Install FS on a Partition.
```
	$ sudo mkfs -t <FS_TYPE> </PATH/PARTITION_NAME>
```

####  6.1.3. Mount the Storage Partition/Device:
After Creation of a Partition and Installation of FS, we need to mount the storage area to be able to use it.

- mount a Storage Partition.
```
	$ mkdir /PATH/<MOUNTING_DIRECTORY>   -> ex. PATH=/mnt or /media or /home/user 
	$ sudo mount -t ext4 /dev/<PARTITION_NAME> /PATH/<MOUNTING_DIRECTORY>
```
##### **IMPORTANT:** this will create a Temporary Mounting Point not <span style="color:red">Permanent</span>.
To Create a Permanent Mounting Point... you need to add it in **`fstab`**.
```
	$ cat /etc/fstab
```
if a reboot occurs... the mounting point will persists normally. 

####  6.1.4. Practice:
**Description:**
 Create two Logical Partitions equally in size... one is ext3 and another is ext4. and mount them in directories located in /mnt
**Steps:** 
	1. Clear Storage.
	2. Unmount Storage if mounted.
	3. Create Partitions and save/write configurations.
	4. Install FS Type to each Partition.
	5. Mount the Partitions.
